## How to start
1. Ask for collaborator status.
2. Clone this project into your folder by `git clone https://github.com/jd1386/blog-challenge.git`
3. Create a folder under your name like `jungdolee` or your blog domain like `leejungdo.com`. (Do *not* add http:// or https:// to the folder name.)
4. Once you've completed a blog post, create a markdown file inside *your* folder.
5. The markdown filename should be formatted as `yymmdd.md` e.g., 181226.md.
6. Fill the markdown file with your post content.
