# blog-challenge
Hello engineers. It's challenge time. Submit your blog post **at least once by the end of every Saturday**. 

## How to start
1. Clone this project into your folder by `git clone https://github.com/jd1386/blog-challenge.git`
2. Create a folder under your name like `jungdolee` or your blog domain like `leejungdo.com`. (Do *not* add http:// or https:// to the folder name.)
3. Once you've completed a blog post, create a markdown file inside *your* folder.
4. The markdown filename should be formatted as `yymmdd.md` e.g., 181226.md.
5. **Important!** Make a commit and push to this repository, so others can read your post.
